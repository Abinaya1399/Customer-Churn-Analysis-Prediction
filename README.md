# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using SQL Server, Power BI, and Python. It involves implementing an ETL process to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading, developing interactive dashboards for data visualization, and deploying a machine-learning model to predict customer churn.

## Project Overview

**Objective:** To analyze customer churn patterns and predict potential churn using machine learning models, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Key Features

- **ETL and Data Analysis:** Implemented a robust ETL process in SQL Server to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading. Performed data cleaning and exploration to ensure data quality. Utilized SQL queries for data aggregation and null value handling, followed by creating views for seamless integration with Power BI.
  
- **Advanced Visualization:** Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key metrics such as customer demographics, account information, and churn patterns. These dashboards enable stakeholders to explore data and derive insights visually.

- **Machine Learning Integration:** Built and deployed a Random Forest machine learning model in Python to predict customer churn. The model was trained using historical customer data, and its results were integrated into Power BI, enhancing the decision-making process.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL Server:** Used for database management, ETL processes, data aggregation, and cleaning.
- **Power BI:** Developed interactive dashboards to visualize data trends and integrate predictive insights.
- **Python:** Utilized for building and deploying the Random Forest machine learning model.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for developing and testing machine learning algorithms.
- **Excel:** Used for initial data handling and exploration.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Extraction and Transformation (ETL):**
   - Extracted data from various sources into SQL Server.
   - Performed data cleaning, handling null values, and creating views for seamless integration.
   
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Analyzed customer demographics, account information, and churn patterns.
   - Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to display key metrics and trends.

3. **Machine Learning Model Development:**
   - Developed a Random Forest model to predict customer churn.
   - Integrated the modelâ€™s predictions into Power BI to visualize results alongside other key data.

## Results

- The project successfully identified key factors contributing to customer churn, enabling the business to focus on high-risk customers.
- The interactive dashboards provided valuable insights into churn patterns and customer behavior.
- The machine learning model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting customer churn, which was used to inform business decisions.
